title: About Nhite
---
_Disclaimer_: Nhite is in its really early development stage.  It may become a product... or not.

### What is _Nhite_ ?
Nhite is a binary that is implementing the [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) engine, but that is exposing a [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) service instead of a cli.

### Do I need _Nhite_? 

If you are working with terraform alone, or if you have susbscribed to [_terraform enterprise_](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/?utm_source=oss&utm_medium=header-nav&utm_campaign=terraform&_ga=2.113562631.1456794510.1505230853-1814147846.1502284566), probably not.

But you may need it if you are willing to:

* work in team with terraform
* easily integrate terraform in a CI/CD
* easily use terraform on multiple environment (Dev, Prod, ...)
* [insert any cool use-case here]

### Does _Nhite_ mean anything?

Nhite stands for N*hi*__te__ is _hip_-**terraform**
