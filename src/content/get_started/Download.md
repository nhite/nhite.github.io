title: Download and test the POC

So far Nhite is mostly a proof-of-concept about how to transform terraform in a gRPC service.

If you want to test what's done so far, you can download a "nhite server" and a "sample nhite client" from github.

* [A simple nhite client](https://github.com/nhite/example-client/releases)
